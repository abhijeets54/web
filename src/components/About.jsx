                    This Punjab-based youth development non-profit organization was established in 2015 with a vision to create young and energetic leaders for the country.

                    The organization has successfully organized various youth conferences in various cities in Punjab and north India and has impacted millions. In the realm of awareness, we believe in the power of knowledge to drive meaningful action.

Through projects like Project Usaari and the Usaari Youth Fest, we're breaking down educational barriers and fostering a culture of learning for all backgrounds.
